# ArChem on Magic Leap

This was a STEC 4500 (Fall 2019) research project developed on the Unity Engine for the Magic Leap platform that successfully projected a set of 3D  molecules into the Magic Leap headset that could be viewed in real space using augmented reality. It was an extension of the idea expressed in this paper: [Augmented Reality Chemistry: Transforming 2-D Molecular Representations into Interactive 3-D Structures Representations into Interactive 3-D Structures ](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context=stem_proceedings)
